[Verse 1]

G                                     Cadd9
Friday night and the lights are low
G                          Em7
Looking out for a place to go
D                           G    D              G
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
            Em7             Em7 - D - Em7
You come to look for a king
G                           Cadd9
Anybody could be that guy
G                              Em7
Night is young and the music's high
D                      G  D             G
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
              Em7
You're in the mood for a dance
             Am             D7
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
G  
You are the dancing queen
Cadd9                 G         Cadd9
Young and sweet, only seventeen
G          
Dancing queen
Cadd9                  G           F#m*    Em7
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
D7                     B7
You can dance, you can jive
Em         F#m*         A7
Having the time of your life
     Cadd9          Am7
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
A7sus       G          Cadd9
Digging the dancing queen

G   Cadd9

[Verse 2]
G                                 Cadd9
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
G                                 Em7
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
D                   Em7/B  D          
Looking out for another,   anyone will do
              Em7           BassF#
You're in the mood for a dance
             Am             D7
And when you get the chance
