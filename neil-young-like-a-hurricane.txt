[Intro]
Am  G   F   Em   G
 
[Verse 1]
Am                            G
Once I thought I saw you in a crowded, hazy bar,
F                                     Em  G
dancing on the light from star to star.
Am                          G
Far across the moon beam, I know that's who you are.
  F                                       Em  G
I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire.
 
[Chorus]
C    G   F        G       C        G    F       G
 You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye,
C    G   F        G
 and I'm getting blown away... 
F                                     Fmaj7
to somewhere safer where the feelings stay.
                                         Am  G   F   Em   G
I wanna love you, but I'm getting blown away.
 
[Verse 2]
Am                       G
I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream,
    F                               Em  G
and you could have been anyone to me.
  Am
Before that moment you touched my lips,
     G
that perfect feeling when time just slips 
 F                                Em  G
away between us and our foggy trip.
 
[Chorus]
C    G   F        G       C        G    F       G
 You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye,
C    G   F        G
 and I'm getting blown away... 
F                                     Fmaj7
to somewhere safer where the feelings stay.
                                        Am  G   F   Em   G
I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away.

[Verse 3]
Am                          G
You are just a dreamer, and I am just a dream,
    F                               Em  G
and you could have been anyone to me.
  Am
Before that moment you touched my lips,
     G
that perfect feeling when time just slips
 F                               Em  G
away between us on our foggy trip.
 
[Chorus]
C    G   F        G       C        G    F       G
 You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye,
C    G   F        G
 and I'm getting blown away... 
F                                     Fmaj7
to somewhere safer where the feelings stay.
                                         Am  G   F   Em   G
I wanna love you, but I'm getting blown away.
