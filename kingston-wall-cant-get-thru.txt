How many times, have I tried to reach you
How many times have I tried to break that disguise
How many times, have I tried to find her
Can't read you behind those eyes cold as ice

There must be someone I just don't know through
Is she familiar I wanna be The to you
I like to know you but I just can't get through
Cause I'd love to know but I just can't get through, to you

When I try to break that ice between you and I
And how much longer will we keep on circling around and around and around
Am I getting further, but never reaching the line

There most be someone I just don't know through
Is she familiar I wanna be there to you (he -heyaa)
I'd like to know you, but I just can't get through
Cuz I'd like to know you, but I just can't get through to you (-ouu)

I just can't get through, to you
.. No-oo.. I Just can't get through.. to yo-ou

[Solo]

I'd like to know you but I just can't get through
Cause I'd like to know you but I just can't get through (yeyee)
There must be someone I just don't know through
Cause I'd like to know you, but I just can't get through.. to you

I'm getting over you
No I just can't
You're just a 'causecal'
That's driving me mad, driving me mad, maad, maad.., maad.. mad mad..

There must be someone I just don't know through
Is she familiar I wanna be there to you (he -heyaa)
I'd like to know you, but I just can't get through
Cuz I'd like to know you, but I just can't get throooou--gh.
