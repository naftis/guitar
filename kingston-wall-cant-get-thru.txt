How many times, have I tried to reach you
How many times have I tried to break the disguise
How many times, have I tried to find her
Can't(/I?) read you behind those eyes cold as ice

There must be someone I just don't know through
Is she familiar I wanna be them to you
I'd like to know you but I just can't get through
Cause I'd love to know you but I just can't get through, to you

How many times, have you turned me down
When I try to break that ice between you and I
And how much longer will we keep on circling around and around and around
Am I(And I'm?) getting further, but never reaching the line

There must be someone I just don't know through
Is she familiar I wanna be them to you
I'd like to know you, but I just can't get through
Cuz I like to know you, but I just can't get through to you

I just can't get through, to you
.. No-oo.. just can't get through.. to yo-ou

I'd like to know you but I just can't get through
Cause I'd like to know you but I just can't get through
There must be someone I just don't know through
Cause I'd like to know you, but I just can't get through.. to you

I can't ignore you
No I just can't
You're just a closed door
That's driving me mad. Thats driving me mad, maad, maad.., maad.. mad mad..

There must be someone I just don't know through
Is she familiar I wanna be them to you
I'd like to know you, but I just can't get through
Cuz I'd like to know you, but I just can't get throooou--gh.
